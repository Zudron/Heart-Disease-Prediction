# Workflow: Heart Disease Prediction Project üß†ü©∫

This document outlines the step-by-step workflow for building a machine learning model to predict heart disease using a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## 1. Problem Definition üéØ
> **Goal:** Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether they have heart disease?

## 2. Data Collection üìä
- **Source:** Cleveland Data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
  - [UCI Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease)
- **Alternative Source:** Kaggle.
  - [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cherngs/heart-disease-cleveland-uci)

## 3. Evaluation üöÄ
- **Objective:** Achieve **‚â•95% accuracy** in predicting heart disease.
- **Challenge:** Hit that sweet spot of accuracy without overfitting!

## 4. Feature Analysis üîç
- **Features:** Detailed breakdown of each attribute.
  - **age:** Age in years
  - **sex:** Sex (1 = male; 0 = female)
  - **cp:** Chest pain type
    - 0: Typical angina
    - 1: Atypical angina
    - 2: Non-anginal pain
    - 3: Asymptomatic
  - **trestbps:** Resting blood pressure (mm Hg)
  - **chol:** Serum cholesterol (mg/dL)
  - **fbs:** Fasting blood sugar (1 = true; 0 = false)
  - **restecg:** Resting electrocardiographic results
    - 0: Normal
    - 1: ST-T wave abnormality
    - 2: Left ventricular hypertrophy
  - **thalach:** Maximum heart rate achieved
  - **exang:** Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
  - **oldpeak:** ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
  - **slope:** Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
    - 0: Upsloping
    - 1: Flat
    - 2: Downsloping
  - **ca:** Number of major vessels colored by flourosopy (0-3)
  - **thal:** Thalassemia
    - 0: Normal
    - 1: Fixed defect
    - 2: Reversible defect
  - **target:** Diagnosis of heart disease (1 = disease, 0 = no disease)

## 5. Modelling üó®Ô∏è
We'll evaluate three different models to determine which one performs best:

1. **Logistic Regression**
   - Hyperparameter Tuning: GridSearchCV on `C` and `solver`

2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
   - Hyperparameter Tuning: Different `n_neighbors` values

3. **Random Forest Classifier**
   - Hyperparameter Tuning: GridSearchCV on `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, `min_samples_split`, and `min_samples_leaf`

## 6. Experimentation üî¨
- **Cross-Validation:** Use 5-fold cross-validation to ensure model generalization.
- **Metrics:** Track precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.
- **Visualization:** Plot ROC curves and confusion matrices for detailed analysis.

## 7. Deployment üöÄ
- **Deployment:** Deploy the best model using AWS Lambda for real-time predictions.
- **API:** Integrate with an API Gateway for seamless access.

## 8. Continuous Improvement üí°
- **Feedback Loop:** Collect user feedback to improve model accuracy.
- **Re-training:** Periodically re-train the model with new data to maintain accuracy.

## Conclusion üèÜ
- Success Criteria: Achieve the target accuracy and ensure the model is reliable and scalable.
- Future Work: Explore deeper model architectures and data preprocessing techniques.
