## Overview
Welcome to the Heart Disease Prediction Project! This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a patient has heart disease based on their medical attributes. We'll use a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and apply various machine learning algorithms to achieve our goal.

## Problem Definition 🎯
Can we predict if a patient has heart disease using clinical parameters? Our mission is to develop a robust machine learning model to help diagnose heart disease accurately.

## Data 📊
- **Source:** Cleveland Data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
  - [UCI Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease)
- **Alternative Source:** Kaggle.
  - [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cherngs/heart-disease-cleveland-uci)

## Evaluation 🚀
Our objective is to achieve **≥95% accuracy** in predicting heart disease. We'll use cross-validation and various metrics to ensure our model is reliable.

## Features 🔍
Each feature in the dataset plays a crucial role. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

- **age:** Age in years
- **sex:** Sex (1 = male; 0 = female)
- **cp:** Chest pain type
  - 0: Typical angina
  - 1: Atypical angina
  - 2: Non-anginal pain
  - 3: Asymptomatic
- **trestbps:** Resting blood pressure (mm Hg)
- **chol:** Serum cholesterol (mg/dL)
- **fbs:** Fasting blood sugar (1 = true; 0 = false)
- **restecg:** Resting electrocardiographic results
  - 0: Normal
  - 1: ST-T wave abnormality
  - 2: Left ventricular hypertrophy
- **thalach:** Maximum heart rate achieved
- **exang:** Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
- **oldpeak:** ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- **slope:** Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
  - 0: Upsloping
  - 1: Flat
  - 2: Downsloping
- **ca:** Number of major vessels colored by flourosopy (0-3)
- **thal:** Thalassemia
  - 0: Normal
  - 1: Fixed defect
  - 2: Reversible defect
- **target:** Diagnosis of heart disease (1 = disease, 0 = no disease)

## Modelling 🗨️
We'll explore several models to find the best one for our dataset:

1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
3. **Random Forest Classifier**

Each model will undergo hyperparameter tuning to optimize its performance.

## Experimentation 🔬
We'll use various techniques to ensure our model is accurate and reliable:

- **Cross-Validation:** 5-fold cross-validation to prevent overfitting.
- **Metrics:** Precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.
- **Visualization:** ROC curves and confusion matrices for detailed analysis.

## Deployment 🚀
The best model will be deployed using AWS Lambda for real-time predictions. We'll also integrate it with an API Gateway for easy access.

## Continuous Improvement 💡
- **Feedback Loop:** Collect user feedback to improve model accuracy.
- **Re-training:** Periodically re-train the model with new data to maintain accuracy.

Conclusion 🏆
Success Criteria: Achieve the target accuracy and ensure the model is reliable and scalable.
Future Work: Explore deeper model architectures and data preprocessing techniques.
Join us on this exciting journey of building a robust heart disease prediction model! 🚀💖
